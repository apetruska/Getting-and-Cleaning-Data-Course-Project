#Summary
run_analysis.R creates a tidy data set from the data at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
Details on the data and how it was collected, units, etc can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Data used
run_analysis.R reads in raw numeric data files: X_test.txt, X_train.txt;
the activity label files: y_test.txt, y_train.txt; the subject identifier files:
subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt; and the column names for the X files contained in features.txt

#Process
After reading in all the files and attaching the column names from features.txt to
both X files, both the test and train data files are subset to only include the 
columns with mean or std in their name. The activity labels from the y files are then
appended onto their respective X file. Next, the resulting test and train data sets
are merged. At this point,it was noted that mean frequency data was included in
the data set, these were removed. 

With the complete data set, the activity numbers were replaced with the corresponding
 name (i.e. the number 1 with walking). Finally, a new data frame was created which
is the mean of each column for each subject and activity. This data frame was 
written to tidied_data.txt.
